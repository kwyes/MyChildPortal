00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.620
Like most of Canada, Vancouver and its area is extremely safe

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.920
Violent crimes are rare. However, like any large urban city

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.860
petty crimes are common

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.820
Areas such as downtown east side of Hasting street

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.120
are to be avoided walking late at night.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.320
Transportation and taxis are generally very safe in Vancouver

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.640
and there are many apps used for navigating the cities.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.060
Students have many opportunities to familiarize themselves with Vancouver before exploring on their own

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.880
as many of our weekend activities are held in and around the city

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.520
led by our first-aid trained staff.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.540
Bodwell High School is located in the city of North Vancouver

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.020
just across the water on the north side of downtown.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.140
North Vancouver is accessible from downtown by the seabus

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.240
or by crossing the Lion's Gate bridge

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.040
It is in a quiet neighbourhood at a roundabout corner

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.220
with a pedestrian trail running along a sea wall at the back of the school

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.740
Students have their own free time after classes and clubs before their study hall and on weekends

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.760
They are free to go out and explore

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.060
but we ask them to swipe their key FOBs when they leave and return to the school

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.380
so staff is aware of their whereabouts.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.560
For their safety outside the school, we conduct workshops

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.400
to ensure they are aware how to avoid danger

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.160
and what to do in the case of getting lost.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.040
Students can call the school anytime - we are reachable 24 hours a day-

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.240
use Google Maps, get a taxi,  or simply ask around

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.320
Canadians are generally very kind and willing to assist.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.500
Students should exercise common sense when outside the school

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.040
and not hesitate to call 911 if they find themselves in a dangerous or emergency situation.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.600
Notifying friends or staff when leaving the campus is a good habit for students

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.360
At night, we require every student to follow curfew

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.660
and be back to their boarding by specific times for their safety

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.940
All new students are assigned a locker

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.860
where they can put away or lock their valuables or personal items

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.140
It is not safe to leave valuables out in the open or in common areas

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.740
During your child's stay here, they may get a bike, skateboard, rollerblade or other large equipment

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.200
The school has safe storage for these items

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.900
We also require them to adhere to the city's by-laws

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.060
such as wearing a helmet while riding their bicycles and following traffic laws.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.720
School staff is here to assist your child in creating a safe, successful, memorable life here at Bodwell.
