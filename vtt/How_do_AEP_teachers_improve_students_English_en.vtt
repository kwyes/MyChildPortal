00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.100
When students are taking AEP courses,

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.540
their teachers do many things

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.360
to help them improve their academic skills.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.040
AEP teachers teach both language and content together.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.220
Students then practice the language

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.120
in a meaningful way using the content learned.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.800
Students learn to think critically

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.620
about a variety of academic topics

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.080
and then are taught how to express their ideas orally or in writing

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.980
using effective strategies.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.035
Scaffolding a lesson is often used

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.020
to support students with weaker English than their classmates.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.900
Teaching strategies are used to manage a multi-level class.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.800
In AEP classes, the teacher

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.680
teaches all four skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening)

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.620
in every class and students will practice them.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.220
The teacher includes a new or reviewed grammar point

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.260
each day for students to practice

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.160
and makes the lessons interesting so students stay motivated

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.760
The teacher teaches students many new academic words

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.560
and important information that will prepare them for academic classes

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.920
He or she gives students many opportunities

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.440
to read interesting books and write on important topics

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.180
and gives them many opportunities to speak on different topics

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.500
The teacher gives the students a lot of homework

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.220
so they can practice the skills learned in class

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.580
and expects their students to read every day for 45 minutes

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.820
The teachers gives students a lot of feedback

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.480
so they know what to work on inside and outside of class

00:01:40.925 --> 00:01:44.265
and helps students understand how they are assessed

00:01:44.265 --> 00:01:46.780
so they can monitor their own progress

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.400
Also, the teacher uses assessment FOR learning,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.760
which is formative

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.780
assessment AS learning which, is self-assessment.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.560
And assessment OF learning which is summative,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.040
to help student progress and succeed.
