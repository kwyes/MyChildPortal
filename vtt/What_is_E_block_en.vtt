00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.000
Welcome to Saturday Enrichment here at Bodwell

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.900
Also known as "E-Block" or "Saturday E".

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.435
This is an opportunity for students to wake up

00:00:13.435 --> 00:00:16.855
on Saturday mornings 10 times in a term.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.440
have classes for 3 hours with instructors from the community or here at the school

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.100
in a wide variety of topics and skill areas.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.500
Why do we do Saturday E?

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.315
We do it for a number of reasons, one of the reasons is

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.880
it helps students to improve their English

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.940
and it gives them more time to practice and use English in different contexts

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.015
Other reasons include: we want students to

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:44.815
spend more time to explore different passions,

00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:47.745
career options, different skills

00:00:47.745 --> 00:00:50.865
and different areas of pursuits in life.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.240
It helps them stand out on their university applications with a lot more experience

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.680
It helps them have connections to the community

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.460
through doing field trips and meeting different interesting guest speakers,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.380
It helps them get real world knowledge about different careers

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.080
different interesting things that are happening in the world

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.800
and finally, it allows students to make good use of their weekend time

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.220
for real learning in a unique setting.

00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:22.405
Each term the students have the opportunity to choose

00:01:22.405 --> 00:01:27.580
from a wide variety of classes depending on their English and grade level.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.600
for students in the younger grades and beginner level English,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.120
we have opportunities for them is classes such as

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.540
English For Life,  Travel and Tourism, Crafts and Cultures

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.480
We blend English learning with other topics and interesting content

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.040
For students in the senior grades and with stronger English

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.280
we have much more challenging courses in the areas of

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:03.180
Sports and Beyond, Engineering, Computer Science, and Electronic Music IESTS test prep.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.940
English 12 support and many, many other courses

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.780
Students often find that we  add new and innovative courses each term

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.700
And we try to have a wide variety of themes

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:24.020
from business to outdoors, athletics, citizenship, volunteering, careers and many other areas as well

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.000
From what I 've experienced students don't mind coming into school Saturday morning

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.240
they actually enjoy the opportunity to get to know people with similar interests

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.180
who share their interests

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.980
and they have the opportunity to explore those interests together

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.900
They really love the opportunity to meet mentors and professionals in their fields of interest

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.240
and they have a lot of fun in the process

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.360
The benefits are very clear.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.440
Students will gain more confidence, more passion, curiosity

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.380
and more well-roundedness.through this program

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.940
I expect students to put in a lot of time and commitment and energy

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.600
In the end the will receive a lot of benefit through this unique opportunity here at Bodwell.
