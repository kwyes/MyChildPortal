00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.000
For boarding students at Bodwell, there is much more to consider

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.940
throughout the day than an average high school student

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.920
Students here are expected to responsibilities in all area their life

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.380
while adapting to a new environment, new school, and new people.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.780
It can be very overwhelming.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.260
For this reason, it is necessary to establish a routine that students can follow,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.660
to help them structure their day and develop the proper time management skills needed

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.180
to be successful in all areas of a boarding student's life

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.300
A student's day begins with the wake-up call at 7 a.m.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.500
By 8:00, all the boarding areas are closed and students

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.580
are not allowed to re-enter until the end of the academic day.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.460
We want students to develop the habit of bringing everything they need from their home to class

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.680
Breakfast is available from 7:25 to 8:15 every morning

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.000
Breakfast is an important meal and we encourage students to eat by extending meal time past boarding closure.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.838
At 3:30 p.m. The school day ends and clubs begin. These run from 3:30 to 4:30

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.340
This is a great opportunity for students to work on

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.400
an extracurricular activity for once,  sometimes twice a week

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.900
From 5:30 dinner is available for all boarding students.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.760
Our cafeteria stays open during supper for 45 minutes

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.660
Study-hall begins at 6:00 with small group tutoring for those requiring extra help

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.480
At 7, Junior study all begins and at 8:15 we have senior study hall, where all senior students attend.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.340
The library also remains open through the evening.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.480
Every Wednesday each individual Hall meets for announcements

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.840
and to discuss issues and further develop life skills and community building.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.280
Every hall meeting is run a little differently.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.580
It allows each hall to develop an individual sense of community within the boarding program.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.840
After study hall snack is available in students of thirty minutes free time

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.500
to begin heading back to their halls for curfew.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.580
By 10:15 students are up in their boarding halls and begin their bedtime routines.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.320
We give students an hour for their bedtime routine.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.340
This is a time for students to wash up,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.800
build a sense of community in their halls as well as relax and reflect before bed.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.100
We have a student that goes around to do the curfew check to-

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.440
We give them some volunteer hours for that.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.210
And then later on the evening we'll go around again just to make sure that everybody is where they're supposed to be.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.379
At 11:00 all students are in their rooms followed by a lights out at 11:30

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.320
Although the weekend schedule varies,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.900
here in boarding we like to keep a structured weekday routine,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.600
to allow students to focus on academics and further develop their life skills.
