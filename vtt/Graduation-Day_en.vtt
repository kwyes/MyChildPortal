00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.880
You know our school is an  international school -  it's a Canadian school

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.200
but full of students from different countries, which is

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.380
very unique

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.989
Finishing, high school at Bodwell is a very significant milestone

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.740
For our graduates it's much more than finishing their study,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.060
it is finishing an important stage of life.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.420
Students, who board at the school gain a lot of life experience

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.700
that we need to stretch our imaginations to understand

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.820
Of course they experience a lot of laughter, fun and excitement

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.980
in school and in the residence every day.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.620
However there are moments of sadness and loneliness

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.300
when some of them miss home,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.180
others not used to the new food, the new situations, and the new people.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.400
Overall, our graduates achieve a much higher level

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.680
of self-management, confidence, and maturity

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.460
compared to other students of similar age. I admire them.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.460
I truly do.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.980
They learn to solve problems and they learn to be independent

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.940
It is much more than academic achievement that our graduates should be proud of.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.070
These students, who come, from home they share this diverse and rich

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.089
socio- cultural environment at Bodwell.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.840
I urge you to pay attention to what our graduates say today.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.080
What they say about their life  and about their aspirations.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.700
Learning to respect people's

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.600
people's cultural beliefs and

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.740
The way they see the world in from their eyes and their perspective

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.760
Perspective

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.900
Perspective

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.080
Perspective

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.540
People and students from all other

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.880
backgrounds, cultures,  and ethnicities

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.220
that come together and make a community

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.380
Community

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.580
Community

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.720
Community

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.080
The greatest lesson i've learned, while I've been here is to be your open-minded and respectful

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.260
Patience, tolerance, and just how to be myself around other people

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.620
Cooperation,

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.820
Identity

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.720
Knowing that everyone is equal

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.020
Perseverance

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.900
Tolerance

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.600
My leadership skills

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.740
Courage

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.780
Harmony

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.280
To respect other's cultures

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.800
I learned how to respect their beliefs

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.110
Respect respect respect

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.500
Another lesson i've learned is maturity

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.420
Independence is very important for a boarding high school student

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.640
I came to Bodwell and I became an independent person

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.780
I see myself impacting, greatly, the lives of young people.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.040
I see myself running for president in Mexico

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.600
I want to be someone who helps other people

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.940
..as a cardiac surgeon saving lives every single day

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.720
...always wanted to become a pilot

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.580
Film Editor

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.180
I will become a lawyer

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.280
I want to be an architect when I grow up

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.380
A journalist

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.840
Surrounded by people I love

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.220
I think the greatest lesson I've learned from my time here

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.020
No matter where you're from or what language you speak,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.880
we can still all work together to make a better world tomorrow.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.040
This environment inspired me a lot.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.500
I'm proud of myself.
