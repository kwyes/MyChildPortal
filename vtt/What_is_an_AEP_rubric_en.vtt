00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.400

to asses student language performance skills demonstrated in class

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.680
Each student has a language rubric

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.180
that all 3 teachers use to asses him or her.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.580
The language rubric is divided into seven sections.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.300
There is a list of specific skills in each of the sections

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.320
that a student must demonstrate by the end of the term.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.980
Teachers checkmark a skill

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.560
using scores 1 through 4.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.800
Score 1 means that the student is struggling to understand

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.400
and demonstrate the skill.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.460
Score 2 means the student has some understanding

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.000
of the skill and is improving stedily..

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.280

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.560
and demonstrates competence.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.820

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.520
giving feedback often

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.880
Using formal and informal evaluation,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.020
teachers keep notes and data to determine scoring for each student throughout the term.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.480
The students are e-mailed their rubrics in weeks 4 or 5

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.200
and are encouraged to follow their own progress

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.840
as they achieve and improve on each skill.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.160

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.740
for each skill area from each of their 3 teachers.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.580
