00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.950
Volunteering is a significant life experience for any high school student studying in BC, Canada

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.560
It is not only a part of the graduation requirement,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.340
but it's also an opportunity for your child to develop characteristics such as:

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:27.029
compassion, resiliency and self motivation  to gain understanding of oneself and others

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.000
to build new friendships and network with the local community

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.329
and also to create a sense of belonging in their new environment.

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.340
At Bodwell High School we understand the importance of this area of life learning

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.640
and the challenges our students may encounter given that they have no direct connections here.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.460
Therefore an extensive support system and programs have been developed

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.440
for students to sign up and participate during weekdays and weekends.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.780
There are individual and group volunteering opportunities that are available for all students to sign up

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.600
and are mentored by school staff

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.020
Students interested in campus jobs and school activities are individually recruited

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.829
and selected through a brief interview process.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.630
As for the group volunteer opportunities,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.680
there are many chances for students to join  local festivals

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.120
to volunteer and help out and to learn their cultures; like this one.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.440
For off-campus community volunteer opportunities,

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.720
the newly designed signup systems allow students to sign up online in their own time

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.780
by accessing their student portal account.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.060
We have also incorporated volunteer opportunities into our Saturday E and after-school clubs.

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.789
By checking in with the parent portal my child website and student portal

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:31.329
both parents and students are able to monitor what students have accomplished during their stay in Bodwell.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.000
They are able to track a student's experience, not only academically,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.800
but also maintain a record of participation in students life skill building activities.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.180
Student life experience and volunteer work are important for post-secondary application and beyond

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.940
It helps your child explore their own sense of self and life direction

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.460
At Bodwell, we hope to promote thoughtfulness and provide a meaningful experience through volunteer work.
