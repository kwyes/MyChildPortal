00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.200
When new students arrive at Bodwell

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.180
they are all given a placement test to determine

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.780
if their level of English is high enough to be successful

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.860
in the Regular Academic Program

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.960
The Academic and English Preparation Program (AEP)

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.520
is a program that supports students

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.880
as they develop their English.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.760
The goal is for students to become competent

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.640
at reading, writing, speaking, and listening.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.060
Bodwell High School offers three terms per year.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.580
Because of this accelerated learning,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.060
it is possible for students to complete 1 to 3 terms of AEP

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.900
and still be on track to graduate

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.860
at the same time as Canadian students.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.400
For students beginning at Bodwell with weaker English,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.060
the AEP program may delay graduation by 1-3 terms,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.740
but the courses taken in AEP

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.060
will benefit all students in all areas of learning,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.740
providing a strong English foundation

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.620
so that they can succeed in high school

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.720
and achieve marks high enough to choose their desired university.
