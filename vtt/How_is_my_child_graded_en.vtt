00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.860
Getting a good grade from a subject,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.240
is seen by most students and parents as the most easy

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.700
and simple measure of results in school.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.880
Now, how are classes graded at Bodwell?

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.000
Grades are in the form of an average percentage

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.160
ora letter grade.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.940
For example, a student getting 95 in Physics 11 is an A

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.900
That shows a very high overall achievement by the student in Physics 11.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.020
Then there are B, C, and Fail.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.220
What is the fuller meaning involved in the grade?

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.060
In fact, how much a student understands, thinks, and uses knowledge in any subject

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.460
is not told by just one letter grade of A or B or C.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.060
A master teacher uses many ways

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.200
to observe, measure, and provide feedback

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.560
on a student's learning, thinking, and understanding.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.520
Mostly, a student learns and presents his learning by answering questions,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.420
oral or written,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.860
in the form of quizzes, tests, and exams.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.660
When these are the same across classes or schools.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.000
We use the term "Standardized Assessment".

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.360
A student also learns by discussing, arguing,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.540
solving problems, designing and completing a project,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.620
and working with other students.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.720
Good teachers observe all these actions

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.660
and give students feedback to provoke further thinking and questioning.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.740
The teacher is measuring the student's learning

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.320
Through a "Formative Process".

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.300
All performances combined into one, final grade.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.460
A final grade for a subject will mean

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.780
combining all that a students learns from

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.640
quizzes, tests, and exams

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.300
discussions, homework, group projects, and presentations.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.800
What is a G.P.A.? - Grade Point Average

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.280
Transcripts give a G.P.A.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.400
meaning that the letter grades are changed into points.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:22.240
A is 4, B-3, C-2. D or "PASS" - 1, Fail is a 0.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.980
The in-betweens of A and B and C and D are a half point.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.860
All points of various subjects are added

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.500
then divided by the number of subjects.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.720
If you still have questions about grades and G.P.A.,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.040
Please speak to any teacher or counsellor.
