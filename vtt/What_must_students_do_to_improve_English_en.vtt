00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.260
Students must do these things to improve their English.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.380
Students placed in the Academic English Preparation (AEP) program

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.160
must work hard in class to learn and practice English.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.680
There are many things that students can do to ensure their English will improve quickly.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.360
English skills are divided into 4 categories:

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.780
Reading, writing, speaking, and listening.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.740
To improve their rating skills,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.480
Students should read for pleasure everyday.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.880
If they read 45-60 minutes

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.240
their comprehension and vocabulary knowledge will improve

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.240
Students should ask themselves questions about the stories or texts they are reading

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.840
The "who, what where when and why" questions are best.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.560
For all comprehension assignments

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.400
Students should make sure they change all incorrect answers.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.440
When reading a novel, short story or fiction text,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.060
students should try to visualize the story in their minds.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.540
To improve writing skills,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.620
students should keep a log or journal of new words.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.020
It is important to fully understand the topic and purpose

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.760
before doing any writing assignment.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.040
Planning a writing assignment is very important.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.820
Editing work after finishing a first draft is essential.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.000
Students should pay attention to all grammar and vocabulary lessons

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.860
and try to use the grammar and vocabulary learned

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.660
in their writing activities.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.140
To further improve their writing skills,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.940
students should write letters,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.380
write in a diary, write descriptive emails,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.200
and write in a reading log

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.820
and should do so in complete sentences as much as possible.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.300
To improve their speaking,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.220
students should ask questions often in class

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.440
and participate in English conversations.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.580
Outside of school,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.340
students should make an effort to speak English whenever possible.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.020
It helps if students have friends from another country.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.640
When students have a oral class presentation to do,

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.560
They should practice beforehand until they feel confident,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.320
working on pronunciation, intonation, and stress will help students speak with more clarity,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.560
To improve their listening,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.140
students should listen actively; this will help with understanding.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.780
While participating in conversations,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.920
a good listener can help acquire a deeper understanding of the subject.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.380
Students can learn a lot by listening to English news reports,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.920
News reports in English, TV shows, and TED talks.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.160
In class, while the teacher talks about a topic,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.400
the students should listen and take notes.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.720
This is active listening

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.700
Progressing in English takes time and effort,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.280
and if students can use English for many hours a day during class and after class,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.920
their ability to communicate fluently

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.560
will develop at a good, strong pace.
