00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.780
We believe that it is really important

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.240
for students to establish good evening study habits

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.020
in order for them to succeed at University

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.460
for this reason we have a program called

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.050
Study hall

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.100
Study hall is an evening program.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.040
It lasts three hours

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.300
and is split into blocks of one hour each.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.900
The first block from 6 o'clock to 7 o'clock is

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.980
optional for most students.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.900
This is an opportunity for students to go see a tutor

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.080
in a classroom and ask for help or clarification.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.120
It's also an opportunity for students in our AEP program

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.020
to be assigned extra work.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.660
From 7 o'clock to 8 o'clock is the Junior study hall.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.900
All juniors must attend their designated classroom

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.620
with their tutor  at this time.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.380
8:15 to 9:15 is the senior study hall,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.220
this is compulsory for all senior students.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.700
Classes are divided up based on English level.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.579
This ensures that all the levels and all the classes are moving at the same pace

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.800
An important part of the study hall program is goal setting

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.940
Each student before study hall begins is to set a goal or

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.260
something they wish to complete or achieve during the study hall hour

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.220
The tutor, then we'll check the goal

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.460
and make sure it is  satisfactory.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.340
The habit of goal setting

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.240
encourages the student to stay focused and plan their time

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.979
so they get the most out of the study hall hour.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.020
At the beginning I usually do the attendance

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.120
and I ask the students log in

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.120
and do the goals  - the study hall goals

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.840
and make sure that

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.860
Throughout the class -their goals- they keep with their goals

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.400
keep up with their goals basically

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.660
checking and making sure that they're  following what they've  written

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.440
- what they supposed to do.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.520
When the class is over,  basically, towards the end,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.740
I do the comment part for each student.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.020
I write the comment for the parents basically so they know

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.400
what the students did during the study hall hour.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.240
Ultimately the study hall program aims to

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.360
improve students grades, their English level,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.520
and the discipline of evening study,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.600
which will help them succeed at university
