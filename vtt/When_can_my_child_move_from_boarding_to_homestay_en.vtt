00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.640
All new students start their Bodwell experienced in boarding.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.860
The Bodwell boarding program provides students with opportunities

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.800
to improve their life skills and become independent young adults.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.680
Through carefully designed programming students are prepared to live more independently.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.260
Once students demonstrate self-discipline and maturity in boarding,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.020
they are invited to apply to graduate from the boarding program

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.300
for the chance to live with an english-speaking Canadian homestay family.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.880
In order to ensure that students are ready for home state we use many different criteria

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.000
Number one: age. Students should be 16 or older.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.180
Number two: Length of time in boarding

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.660
Students should spend at least two terms in boarding so their life skills can be properly assessed

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.720
Number three: good academic results

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.340
As homestay students, students will need to be more independent in their study habits

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.119
and will not have the tutoring and study hall support that boarding offers.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.140
We need to make sure that they can plan their study routines on their own

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.080
Number four: Behaviour. Students should not have had any disciplinary issues.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.620
If they are on behavioral probation or have had recent disciplinary issues They will not be allowed to move to homestay

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.060
Number five: Life skills.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.100
Students should have a strong life skill score.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.840
This score will allow us to measure student's readiness for independent living

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.000
The score is shown on the boarding report card that is received by parents regularly.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.060
Once all of these factors are considered

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.520
Students will either be accepted or rejected in their request to leave boarding

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.660
and move to a Bodwell homestay.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.869
It is important to remember that for safety reasons,

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.659
homestay is a privilege that is earned. Only those that have truly mastered the ability to be independent,

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.968
both in their life skills and in their study habits, will be successful in a homestay.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.880
Through our experience we want to ensure that all students that go to homestay continue to be successful at Bodwell

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.500
