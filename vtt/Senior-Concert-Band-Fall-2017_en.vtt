00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.120
The senior concert band is a group of students who are more advanced,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.640
they’ve played for at least one term in the beginning band

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.780
or have played for a couple years

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.240
The senior concert band is a club, it’s something that they do for fun,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.660
they get together for a stress release

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.340
and the piece that we played was for the “Evening of Music”

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.580
which is the concert we put on.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.660
The piece is called “Stone Mountain Fantasy”.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.160
It’s supposed to be like a Lord of the Rings-type journey is how I imagined it

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.320
you’ve got the idea of epic vistas and a battle

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.460
and then a love story in the middle sort of thing

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.240
and then back to the battle and they win!

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.920
That’s sort of what the piece is about.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.800
I think from this experience they got to learn more about

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.740
what it means to be a professional musician

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.680
and what it means to be a professional.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.680
And to be in an environment where they have to do something more than once.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.500
They got to see someone from an artistic side

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.840
take shots and put something together.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.040
We talked about what it meant to be a professional touring musician, for example.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.760
They got to get a glimpse behind the scenes

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.520
of what it really is to be a musician in his day and age

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.360
which is something we don’t often talk about while working on our pieces.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.640
So, I think that was a really important thing for them to be exposed to

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.800
as it allowed them to get a glimpse, if they choose to be musicians as a career,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.920
what that could look like for them in the future.
