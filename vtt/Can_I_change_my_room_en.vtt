00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.280
Parents sometimes ask us about dormitory rooms for their children

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.060
Now, we don't accept requests for rooms and roommates,

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.020
and here's why

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.540
At Bodwell our dormitory rooms are organized into halls

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.260
There is a wide variety of room shapes. sizes, and locations.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.100
For new students, when they arrive boys and girls are divided

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.280
and then grouped into halls

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.940
to mix up their ages and their countries.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.540
Within these halls,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.560
Students are assigned by advisors to rooms

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.260
We make sure there are at least 2 languages spoken in each room

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.880
Each day through boarding life

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.320
our students overcome problems

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.520
they meet new people

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.480
they use English to make diverse friends

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.920
All of these are important life skills

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.760
Now, after 10 days of arriving

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.400
students wishing to change their rooms

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.200
can ask their advisor

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.680
Their advisor will consider the request and make a decision

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.500
If somebody wants a room change they would usually come to their advisor

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.000
and say they have a problem with their roommate

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.320
or they don't like their room

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.320
and we talk about what that is and talk about a solution

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.900
to actually make sure they are comfortable in their room.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.740
Usually what students realize is they get an opportunity

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.820
to practice conflict resolution and conflict management

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.020
and see what that looks like and how to compromise

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.400
with that they get to know other students from different cultures

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.660
they get to know other students that speak different languages

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.680
and they end up ultimately staying in the room they were originally put in

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.400
because they end up building strong relationships with the students they're there with

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.800
We hope your children will be very happy and comfortable here, living in the dormitory

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.960
However we really hope the students make the best of this opportunity

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.920
to learn how to live with different people

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.520
...very essential for international careers

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.560
and getting ready for university
