The "My Child" website is a password protected portal for parents

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.000
to view their child's progress while at Bodwell.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.360
To begin, we recommend Chrome or Safari as the site is optimized for these platforms.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.980
There are a number of ways to reach the portal. You can go through our website at bodwell.edu

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.680
and then find the ".community" tab

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.860
or by typing mychild.bodwell.edu directly into you browser.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.280
Once logged in, you are taken to the "My Child" dashboard

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.040
which is an overview of all of child's information.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.980
There are 7 components to this dashboard.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.600
The 4 tabs at the top; we are currently on the first tab labelled "My Child".

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.160
Second is your child's information including the house and hall they belong to,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.120
and how long they have been enrolled at Bodwell.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.820
This section is for general announcements and reminders.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.180
This is the academic overview of your child

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.860
You have a quick glance at the current courses, grades well as their attendance.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.660
A more detailed look at each student's academics can be found under the "Academic Record" tab

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.600

Back to the tabs, clicking "Academic Record"

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.700

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.580
We call this the "Grade Book"

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.020
Clicking this box, a list of current courses will drop down.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.420
The second box on the right will reveal components that will make up the grade

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.100
and how it is weighted for the final mark.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.860
In this example, we can see that assignments are worth 20% of the final grade,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.320
quizzes 5% and tests 40%.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.980
