It’s for students that are in the art clubs or in Art 11/12, or in Art 8/9.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.180
So, in their art classes they make a lot of projects and then they get to put their work up.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.160
They get to put their work up and display their best work.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.440
They get to choose what their best work is

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.380
and then every student gets a chance to put their work in the show and show it off

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.860
Students take a foundations course

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.320
and that means that they get to do sculpture, they do ceramic,

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.780
they do painting, they do collage, they do drawing techniques.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.440
So basically, there’s everything through all those disciplines

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.340
and they get to show what their best work was in those projects.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.400
There’s things like masks for “Day of the Dead”

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.480
and all my students took part in those masks.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.440
Some students did mosaics,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.340
we did a bunch of still life

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.580
and then some students went on field trips

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.960
so what’s behind me right here is from a field trip to the Vancouver Art Gallery

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.720
and they went to an Emily Carr exhibit and then did a workshop

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.460
Mashu Higa, actually he is in the North Shore News this week for his art

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.360
And he is creating a work on “crowd-sourcing”.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.520
Getting people together to participate in his art.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.200
They are putting a pin where they live in the world, where they come from

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.500
and then on the piece that he created he drew a piece of himself,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.300
kind of like a self-portrait

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.560
there putting pins where they live or come from and then they are writing a comment

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.360
about where they come or about Canada on the piece,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.440
so they get to actually participate in the piece which is really neat

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.340
Mashu’s work is actually part of his application for Emily Carr,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.960
They get you to do a project, so this is for him to get to work on his application

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.380
While he is actually in art class
