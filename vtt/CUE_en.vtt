00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.920
The CUE event is an event that's held every year at Bodwell

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.800
where 50 Canadian universities come to Bodwell to speak to our students

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.200
They have the opportunities to speak directly to admission reps from various universities

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.620
ask them questions about admission

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.040
and admission requirements. We actually encourage grades 10 11 and 12 students to attend

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.229
They can ask any question regarding

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.220
admission requirements everything from averages needed

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:58.480
Courses that universities are looking for, supplementary applications, and other criterias that universities might be looking for

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.440
Since not all university requirements are the same

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.080
it's imperative for students to talk to the admission officers

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.760
from various universities to ask them specific questions about their admission criteria and requirements

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:29.220
Bodwell hosts the CUE event to give our students opportunity to speak to those university reps in person

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.720
The next step for our students is to do a follow up with their counselors by sitting down with them

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.580
They sit down with the counselors one-on-one after the event to discuss the various options

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.480
and opportunities they have learned themselves at the CUE event

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.780
Rather than having our students miss school to go meet

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.329
50 universities at 50 different locations

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:09.100
It's an opportunity for our students to have all 50 reps in one place and talk to them in person

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.660
They can also make personal connection with the University reps

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.709
They will have their contact information and they will be able to contact them one-on-one in case they needed to

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.239
Prior to attending this event

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.329
students are encouraged in class,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.520
and through meeting with counsellors to ask specific questions to the University reps

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.840
Those questions are discussed in CLE  classes and when the students meet with their counsellors back again 1 on 1
