00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.140
If students are placed in the academic English preparation program

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.520
the amount of time these students will spend in AEP varies.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.400
Students placed in level one will complete the AEP program in four, five or six terms.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.810
Students placed in level two will complete the AEP program in three, four or five terms.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.560
In Level three, they will complete the AEP program in two, three or four terms.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.680
And in level four they will complete the program in one or two terms

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.940
Students who arrive with very weak English will take longer,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.700
Students who study hard speak English a lot

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.000
and read English books will progress faster.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.360
Students who participate extracurricular programs

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.660
and interact with students from other countries will progress faster

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.380
All students arrive at Bodwell with different English experiences

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.680
some students have learned a little English before arriving

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.700
but have never practiced it.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.760
Some students have studied English for many years in their home countries

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.400
or have studied English in other countries other before arriving at Bodwell.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.200
Some students have completed high school courses

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.540
at a Canadian public school.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.780
It's very important for students that wish to progress through the AEP program

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.020
and get ready

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.900
for the regular academic program as quickly as possible

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.780
that they get involved and they use English

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.120
as much as they can outside of the classroom.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.020
There's many opportunities

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.440
such as our Saturday enrichment program

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.960
our study Hall sessions with our tutors, our clubs,

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.770
teams, boarding activities,

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.509
volunteer opportunities

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.260
and daily life where they speak

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.160
and learn with other students from other different countries

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.960
all of these things help students progress through the AEP program

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.800
and get ready, have those essential skills

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.460
needed for academic success.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.960
Older students age 17, with weak English

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.460
struggle to complete the AEP program

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.300
and the regular academic program

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.080
before they reach the age of 18  or 19

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.280
Younger students must learn English,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.020
life skills and become mature all at the same time.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.620
Young students progress at different rates.
